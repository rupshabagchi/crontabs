# My Scripts

These are some very basic scripts that I use almost everyday to make my life easier. 

#### The List

* ***wifi-reset.sh*** : restarts the wireless interface after a certain time
* ***anagram.py*** : finds all the anagrams for a given word

#### For cron tabs

 `chmod +x <jobname>`
 
 //scheduling your crontab according to your specific time requirements
 
  `00 09-18 * * * wifi-reset.sh`
